YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

Before receiving warranty service, 4BLANC or its agents may require that you provide a proof of purchase details, respond to questions designed to assist with diagnosing potential issues and follow 4BLANC's procedures for obtaining warranty service.

Following warranty service, your 4BLANC Product or a replacement device will be returned to you as your 4BLANC Product was configured when originally purchased, subject to applicable upgrades with renewed parts or elements.

IN WARRANTY CASES

If during the Warranty Period you submit a claim to 4BLANC or an ASP in accordance with this warranty, 4BLANC will, at its option:

(i) repair the 4BLANC Product using new or previously used 4BLANC genuine parts that have been tested and passed 4BLANC functional requirements,

(ii) replace the 4BLANC Product with a replacement product of the same model (or with your consent a product that has the same or substantially similar features as the original product – e.g., a different model with the same features, or the same model in a different color) that is new or comprised of new and/or previously used 4BLANC genuine parts and has been tested and passed 4BLANC functional requirements, or

(iii) exchange the 4BLANC Product for a refund of your purchase price.

4BLANC may request that you replace certain user-installable parts or 4BLANC Products. A replacement part or 4BLANC Product, including a user-installable part that has been installed in accordance with instructions provided by 4BLANC, assumes the remaining term of the Warranty or ninety (90) days from the date of replacement or repair, whichever provides longer coverage for you. When a 4BLANC Product or part is replaced or a refund provided, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced or refunded item becomes 4BLANC's property.

OBTAINING THE WARRANTY SERVICE

Please access and review the online help resources on this website before seeking warranty service. If the 4BLANC Product is still not functioning properly after making use of these resources, please contact 4BLANC Customer Support, or representative or, or ASP, using the information provided below. A 4BLANC representative or ASP will help determine whether your 4BLANC Product requires service and, if it does, will inform you how 4BLANC will provide it.

Online information with details on obtaining warranty service is provided below.

WARRANTY SERVICE OPTIONS

4BLANC will provide warranty service through one or more of the following options:

(i) Carry-in service. You may return your 4BLANC Product to an 4BLANC ASP location at your territory offering carry-in service. Service will be performed at the location. Once you are notified that service is complete, you will retrieve the 4BLANC Product from the 4BLANC or ASP location without delay, unless 4BLANC notifies you that the 4BLANC Product will be sent directly to your location from the ARS location.

(ii) Mail-in service. If 4BLANC determines that your 4BLANC Product is eligible for mail-in service, 4BLANC will send you prepaid waybills and if applicable, packaging material and instructions on how to properly pack and address your 4BLANC product, so that you may ship your 4BLANC Product to an ARS or ASP location. Once service is complete, the ARS or ASP location will return the 4BLANC Product to you. 4BLANC will pay for shipping to and from your location if all instructions regarding the method of packaging and shipping the 4BLANC Product are followed.

(iii) Do-it-yourself (DIY) parts service. DIY parts service allows you to service your own 4BLANC Product. If DIY parts service is available in the circumstances, the following process will apply.

(a) Service where 4BLANC requires return of the replaced 4BLANC Product or part. 4BLANC may require a credit card authorization as security for the retail price of the replacement 4BLANC Product or part and applicable shipping costs. If you are unable to provide credit card authorization, DIY parts service may not be available to you and 4BLANC will offer alternative arrangements for service. 4BLANC will ship a replacement 4BLANC Product or part to you with installation instructions, if applicable, and any requirements for the return of the replaced 4BLANC Product or part. If you follow the instructions, 4BLANC will cancel the credit card authorization, so you will not be charged for the 4BLANC Product or part and shipping to and from your location. If you fail to return the replaced 4BLANC Product or part as instructed or return a replaced product or part that is ineligible for service, 4BLANC will charge your credit card for the authorized amount.

(b) Service where 4BLANC does not require return of the replaced 4BLANC Product or part. 4BLANC will ship you free of charge a replacement 4BLANC Product or part accompanied by instructions on installation, if applicable, and any requirements for the disposal of the replaced 4BLANC Product or part.

(c) 4BLANC is not responsible for any labor costs you incur relating to DIY parts service. Should you require further assistance, contact 4BLANC.

4BLANC reserves the right to change the method by which 4BLANC may provide warranty service to you, and your 4BLANC Product's eligibility to receive a particular method of service. Service will be limited to the options available in the country where service is requested. Service options, parts availability and response times may vary according to country. 4BLANC may use 4BLANC Products or replacement parts for service that are sourced from a country that is different from the country from which the 4BLANC Product or original parts were purchased. You may be responsible for shipping and handling charges if the 4BLANC Product cannot be serviced in the country it is in. If you seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, you will comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. For international service, 4BLANC may repair or replace 4BLANC Products and parts with comparable 4BLANC Products and parts that comply with local standards.
